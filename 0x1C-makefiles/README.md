# Makefiles and Python Utility Project

## Overview

This project contains a series of Makefiles and a Python utility script demonstrating
various build configurations and a specific algorithmic implementation.

## File Structure

### Makefiles

- `0-Makefile`: Basic Makefile configuration
- `1-Makefile`: Enhanced Makefile with additional configurations
- `2-Makefile`: Further improved Makefile
- `3-Makefile`: Another iteration of Makefile
- `4-Makefile`: Advanced Makefile configuration
- `5-Makefile`: (Potentially final or most complex Makefile configuration)

### Python Utility

- `100-Makefile`: Likely a specialized Makefile related to the Python script
- `5-island_perimeter.py`: Python script for calculating island perimeter

## 5-island_perimeter.py

This Python script appears to implement an algorithm for calculating the perimeter of an island represented in a grid.

### Possible Usage

```python
def island_perimeter(grid):
    # Implementation of island perimeter calculation
    # Likely determines the total border length of land cells in a 2D grid
```

## Makefile Progression

The Makefiles (0-5) likely demonstrate an incremental approach to build configurations, potentially showing:

- Basic compilation commands
- Variable usage
- Dependency management
- Compilation flags
- Build optimization techniques

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Make utility
- Appropriate compiler (depending on the specific Makefile configurations)

## How to Use

1. Review individual Makefiles to understand their specific configurations
2. For the Python script, ensure you have Python installed
3. Use `make` commands as specified in the respective Makefiles

## Notes

- Each Makefile may have unique compilation or build strategies
- The progression from 0 to 5 suggests a learning or refinement process in build configuration

## Contributing

Feel free to explore, modify, and learn from these configuration files and the Python utility script.
